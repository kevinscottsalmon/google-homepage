# google-homepage
CSS/HTML Project for TheOdinProject 

This project is designed to apply the skills learned in introductory CSS and HTML courses, via TheOdinProject.com. 

In the project, we implemented <div>, <span>, <a>, <input>, dropdown buttons, etc. to replicate the Google homepage. Most of the links are active, however, things similar to the search input form lead nowhere. We also applied CSS to size, locate, and decorate features.
